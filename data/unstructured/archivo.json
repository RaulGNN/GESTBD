The Salamanca district, ordered to be built by the Marquis of Salamanca at the end of the 19th century, is the prototype of urban expansion, garden city and aristocratic neighborhood with large avenues around which luxury shops and businesses are organized, and magnificent palaces, in one of which the Sevillian writer Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer lived. Traditionally, Salamanca was a residential area, especially inhabited by the political and economic elites of the country. In the last fifty years, this residential character has coexisted with other activities such as business, diplomacy and, especially, commerce, since it is one of the most important luxury fashion areas in the capital."

You will hardly find 198 meters of classical harmony and serene design in perfect condition. The moldings and rosettes of the very high ceilings (3.5m) from the end of the 19th century sound like a piano throughout the house. The 3 balconies illuminate the infinite living room. The natural beveled oak of the floor (pieces of 3m x 30cms) provides warmth meter by meter. Every detail is sublime. Look at the height of the baseboards (25 cms) The incredible doors of 2.40 m high, contemporary versus modern. The very large dining room connected to the living room next to the exquisite high-end Italian design kitchen with countertops made of a single piece. Have you ever seen a hexagonal master bedroom? Of course with en suite bathroom. Or some restored silver cabinets converted into wardrobes. It is worth taking a close look at the original flooring of this room; a true work of art masterfully restored. Speechless. In addition, next to the bedroom you also have an original dressing room. And a large shoe rack. The second bathroom is also a work of art in itself. With two large windows, two sinks, a very large shower and also a large separate bathtub. At the end of the majestic corridor are the other two large and bright rooms. Isolated from the rest of the house to favor privacy. More details that surely interest you: the old adapted cast iron radiators with the original legs and cranks. The air conditioning installation is individualized in all rooms. PVC kommerling with thermal and acoustic bridge break tilt-and-turn windows throughout the house. As if all this were not enough, the house has a 55-meter attic with a skylight as a storage room on the top floor. A step away from the Teatro Real, the Royal Palace, the Almudena Cathedral and in the area of the new Great Luxury of Madrid Centro."

Every borough in Madrid has its own story, its charm. In the case of the borough of Palacio, we have an area with streets that have witnessed the entire history of the city; from the middle ages, when Madrid was only a fortress, to the pre-baroque, when Philip II made it the capital of the Kingdom, to the arrival of the Bourbons in the eighteenth century or its expansion in the twentieth century, which can be seen in the final section of the Gran Via. Indeed, the borough of Palacio provides a glimpse into the history of Madrid. All Spain's monarchs have left their mark here. Even Joseph Bonaparte, who conceived the current Oriente Square, left his mark.  This is a very pleasant place to live, particularly since the pedestrianisation of the area around the Royal Palace, the Almudena Cathedral and Oriente Square and, more recently, Arenal and Mayor streets. However, in addition to the large and peaceful gardens, we have the lively and dynamic nature of Madrid. That \"rogue\" Madrid, full of typical bars, outstanding restaurants or gastronomic centres, such as the San Miguel Market. There is something in Palacio that defines it as a borough: a perfect balance between a quiet life and the liveliness of a great European metropolis."

Every borough in Madrid has its own story, its charm. In the case of the borough of Palacio, we have an area with streets that have witnessed the entire history of the city; from the middle ages, when Madrid was only a fortress, to the pre-baroque, when Philip II made it the capital of the Kingdom, to the arrival of the Bourbons in the eighteenth century or its expansion in the twentieth century, which can be seen in the final section of the Gran Via. Indeed, the borough of Palacio provides a glimpse into the history of Madrid. All Spain's monarchs have left their mark here. Even Joseph Bonaparte, who conceived the current Oriente Square, left his mark.  This is a very pleasant place to live, particularly since the pedestrianisation of the area around the Royal Palace, the Almudena Cathedral and Oriente Square and, more recently, Arenal and Mayor streets. However, in addition to the large and peaceful gardens, we have the lively and dynamic nature of Madrid. That \"rogue\" Madrid, full of typical bars, outstanding restaurants or gastronomic centres, such as the San Miguel Market. There is something in Palacio that defines it as a borough: a perfect balance between a quiet life and the liveliness of a great European metropolis."

The Salamanca district, built at the Salamanca Marquis's order at the end of the XIXth Century and on which he spent most of his fortune, is the prototype of urban development, an aristocratic neighbourhood with large avenues that drive traffic to the many shops and luxury brands available, as well as imposing palaces - the Sevillan writer Gustavo Adolfo B\u00e9cquer lived in one of them. A walk within the streets of this exclusive neighbourhood offers a pleasant sensation of entering an exclusive aristocratic world. Brands such as Loewe, Lubaloo, Prada, Valentino, Miu Miu, Cartier and many others delight the most wealthy residents of this neighbourhood called the Golden Mile. The maximum indicator of luxurious gastronomy is the Platea City Mall, full with restaurants such as Ram\u00f3n Freixa or Sinergias, which resulted from the union of three of the most valuable Spanish chefs. They attract visitors with innovative recipes and enviable sweets of Mam\u00e1 Framboise, among others.

It is located near Ventas del Esp\u00edritu Santo and is delimited by Avenida de Am\u00e9rica and the streets of Francisco Silvela, Alcal\u00e1, and M-30.

The Breog\u00e1n park, next to the M-30, and the Eva Duarte park in Manuel Becerra are located on the outskirts of the neighborhood.

Do not hesitate and come to know this house, considered a luxury in Madrid. We are waiting for you! The Salamanca neighborhood is one of the most important areas of Madrid, both for its peculiar distribution and for the neighbors who have traditionally inhabited its emblematic streets.  Its construction dates from the second half of the 19th century and corresponds to the urban expansion carried out during the reign of Isabel II. The precursor to whom it owes its name was the Malaga-born Jos\u00e9 de Salamanca y Mayol, Marquis of Salamanca, who conceived a new site with a careful construction that would house the aristocratic and bourgeois classes of Madrid.  Of nineteenth-century style, it is characterized by its special regular distribution in the form of a checkerboard with perpendicular streets. Its buildings are of special interest thanks to their architectural quality and the beauty of their facades. Traditionally Salamanca was a residential area, especially inhabited by the political and economic elites of the country. In the last fifty years this residential character coexists with other activities such as business, diplomatic and especially commercial, as it is one of the most important luxury fashion areas of the capital."

It consists of a large hall (which the previous tenant used as an office), a living-dining room with a fully equipped integrated kitchen, a separate bedroom and two complete bathrooms, one of them with a free-standing bathtub and shower in which the laundry area is included. The possibilities of reform are endless, since it could be with a specific and quite easy reform, convert into a two-bedroom apartment with en suite bathrooms, as shown in the second plane, or redistribute it to create a very spacious 45 m2 living room and a bedroom with dressing room and bathroom in suite. The prices of the two reforms that we propose would be around 35,000-40,000 euros. Malasa\u00f1a has become today one of the most popular areas in the center of Madrid, forming an irregular square flanked by Gran V\u00eda to the south, Fuencarral street to the east, Carranza street to the north and, finally, San Bernardo street to the west. In the Malasa\u00f1a neighborhood there are some of the most desirable open spaces in the capital. They are usually very crowded and through them passes, at the same time, the life of the neighborhood and that of the big city. The rest of its streets are narrow and lively, some pedestrianized, perfect for strolling. The historic Plaza del Dos de Mayo, full of lively bars and market stalls on weekends, is a popular meeting point. The Conde Duque cultural center exhibits works of art and screens outdoor films in its 18th-century rooms and courtyards. Call us or write us by whatsapp and find out! Orbis Alia: \/."

The house has 4 floors: The house is accessed by a large Sicilian granite staircase with garden and lights on the side. Entering the basement we have a large hall with many closets and a courtesy toilet. You can also see the staircase as a sculptural element of the house and we also find a large multipurpose room (also a bedroom) as well as the service bedroom with its bathroom. All with large windows and exterior ventilation. At the same level, but with its totally independent access through another beautiful patio of about 16m2, we access an isolated and independent area of the house that consists of a complete bathroom and a multipurpose room: office with living room or bedroom for 3 people. You can also access the house by going up some stairs from the entrance to the garden and through another large terrace of about 22m2 that leads to the kitchen. This terrace is ideal to consider a large outdoor dining table. The kitchen has a lot of light and, like the whole house, it is completely renovated with high qualities. Then we find a large open-plan living-dining room without pillars, which can also be reached from the aforementioned stairs. In this one there is a huge built-in bookcase and a large and deep custom-made carpentry closet. It is completely open to the outside of the house so its light is incredible. When visiting the house, the aerothermal functionality of the staircase is explained next to the large windows of the living room and the beautiful skylight that can be opened at the top of it. The garden is divided into different areas according to its use: outdoor living room with fireplace, solarium, barbecue, etc... in the renovation an old spectacular white grape climbing vine was respected that guarantees shade during the summer to the outdoor living room area. This demonstrates the care with which the comprehensive reform of the house was carried out and the respect for its original elements.

Roundabout where the Paseo de la Florida and Avenida de Valladolid converge. From the Pr\u00edncipe P\u00edo station you can reach the hermitages along the Paseo de la Florida. The neighboring Madrid R\u00edo park allows you to finish your journey crossing the Manzanares riverbed through the Reina bridge. Nearby are the rose garden of the Parque del Oeste and the Madrid cable car, which offers aerial views of the area. Numerous restaurants located in the old pavilions of the Feria del Campo and the kiosks around the lake. Walking or cycling, you can access the Casa de Campo through eleven gates: those of the R\u00edo or del Rey and that of Moreras to the east; those of Bat\u00e1n, Venta, Dante, Grande and \u00c1ngel to the south; and those of Aravaca, Somosaguas, Rodajos and Zarz\u00f3n to the west, from where there is also an entrance through half a dozen gates.

All the daytime urban and intercity lines that had their terminus at the old Pr\u00edncipe P\u00edo bus station, in front of the station building, in the Glorieta de San Vicente or in the Paseo de la Virgen del Puerto have been progressively incorporated into the interchange, together with some that had their terminus at the Madrid South Bus Station.

Large social area and two bedrooms en suite, ready to move into in style. Distribution: Reception area in two rooms, living room and dining room that look out through two French balconies onto one of the most popular streets in the area. Designer kitchen with island and laundry room in an independent space open to the dining room, equipped with high-end appliances. In the private area we find two comfortable bedrooms, the main one with a dressing room and an en-suite bathroom. Location: The Justicia neighborhood takes its name from the Superior Court of Justice, which is located next to other emblematic buildings such as the church of Santa B\u00e1rbara, the Convent of the Salesas, the Pacha nightclub, one of the few rationalist buildings in Madrid, the Palacio de Longoria (Sociedad de Autores), an icon of modernist architecture, the Palacio de Villagonzalo, in front of which this property is located, and a long etcetera. The avant-garde commercial offer with fashion stores, restaurants and boutique hotels joins the intense cultural activity of its theaters and art galleries. Strolling through streets that have already become a \u201cmust\u201d such as Barquillo, Conde de Xiquena, Orellana, Fernando Sexto or Mej\u00eda Lequerica, is a real delight. The well-kept facades are reminiscent of a Parisian neighborhood. We are facing the fashionable neighborhood par excellence of Madrid and one of the most revitalized in recent years. Orientation: The property faces east and receives direct sunlight during the morning, with cross light through its patios. Uniqueness: Without a doubt, the extraordinary interior design work and the magnificent qualities, with a very current proposal, are one of the main attractions of this property, avant-garde and comfortable, with everything you need to live or as an asset for profitability. A double turnkey, the most demanded format, in the trendiest area of the capital. Conservation: The condition of the building is good, with a favorable ITE from 2019. The exclusive reform adapts the distribution and infrastructures to today's life, such as designer furniture, the modern kitchen with an island close to the social area, and first-class facilities. Noble materials, oak parquet floors, thermal and acoustic insulation and ducted air conditioning, high-end appliances and LED lighting. Profitability: Investing in the Justicia neighborhood is highly recommended given its very high demand and scarce supply, especially when it comes to turnkey properties. It is one of the most revalued areas, in which an important effort is being made that has turned its streets, sidewalks, facades and squares around. An exquisite environment, very careful and attractive to invest. A safe and sustainable value that still has a way to go today."
